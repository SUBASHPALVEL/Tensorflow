But this may sound familiar to what our densly connected neural network, well that's because it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental difference between a dense layer and a convolutional layer is that dense layers detect patterns globally while convolutional layers detect patterns locally. When we have a densly connected layer each node in that layer sees all the data from the previous layer. This means that this layer is looking at all the information and is only capable of analyzing the data in a global capacity. Our convolutional layer however will not be densly connected, this means it can detect local patterns using part of the input data to that layer.\n",

    "### How They Work\n",
    "A dense neural network learns patterns that are present in one specific area of an image. This means if a pattern that the network knows is present in a different area of the image it will have to learn the pattern again in that new area to be able to detect it. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Let's use an example to better illustrate this.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll consider that we have a dense neural network that has learned what an eye looks like from a sample of dog images.\n",

    "![alt text](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1V7Dh7BiaOvMq5Pm_jzpQfJTZcpPNmN0W)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our densly connected network has only recognized patterns globally it will look where it thinks the eyes should be present. Clearly it does not find them there and therefore would likely determine this image is not a dog. Even though the pattern of the eyes is present, it's just in a different location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since convolutional layers learn and detect patterns from different areas of the image, they don't have problems with the example we just illustrated. They know what an eye looks like and by analyzing different parts of the image can find where it is present. \n",

    "In our models it is quite common to have more than one convolutional layer. Even the basic example we will use in this guide will be made up of 3 convolutional layers. These layers work together by increasing complexity and abstraction at each subsequent layer. The first layer might be responsible for picking up edges and short lines, while the second layer will take as input these lines and start forming shapes or polygons. Finally, the last layer might take these shapes and determine which combiantions make up a specific image.\n",

    "A filter is a m x n pattern of pixels that we are looking for in an image. The number of filters in a convolutional layer reprsents how many patterns each layer is looking for and what the depth of our response map will be. If we are looking for 32 different patterns/filters than our output feature map (aka the response map) will have a depth of 32. Each one of the 32 layers of depth will be a matrix of some size containing values indicating if the filter was present at that location or not.\n",

They work in a similar way to convolutional layers where they extract windows from the feature map and return a response map of the max, min or average values of each channel. Pooling is usually done using windows of size 2x2 and a stride of 2. This will reduce the size of the feature map by a factor of two and return a response map that is 2x smaller."

We know that CNN's alone (with no dense layers) don't do anything other than map the presence of features from our input. This means we can use a pretrained CNN, one trained on millions of images, as the start of our model. This will allow us to have a very good convolutional base before adding our own dense layered classifier at the end. In fact, by using this techique we can train a very good classifier for a realtively small dataset (< 10,000 images). This is because the convnet already has a very good idea of what features to look for in an image and can find them very effectively. So, if we can determine the presence of features all the rest of the model needs to do is determine which combination of features makes a specific image."
